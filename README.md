# buying-tickets-spot-bot.py
This is a bot for buying tickets for a show in minecraft. Since I am an event organizer, I started accepting payments through the api https://sub.spot-land.com . 
This site works on a private closed minecraft project Ru segment. In fact, this is my very first bot. So there's a bit of smut in there. 
I could upload an older version, but there are fewer chips. So something like this .... 
With the help of this bot, you can understand how the api site https://sub.spot-land.com works. 
Hope my code was helpful
